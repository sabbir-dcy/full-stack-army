# Programming

## What is programming?

- Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

## What is a program?

- A program is a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

## Programming Paradigms

- Imperative
  - Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state.
  - Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.
  - Imperative programming languages include C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, and Perl.
- Declarative
  - Declarative programming is a programming paradigm that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.
  - Declarative programming focuses on what the program should accomplish without specifying how the program should achieve the result.
  - Declarative programming languages include SQL, HTML, CSS, and XSLT.
- Functional
  - Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.
  - Functional programming languages include Haskell, Erlang, Clojure, and F#.
- Object-Oriented
  - Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.
  - Object-oriented programming languages include Java, C++, C#, Python, Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript.
- Procedural
  - Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call.
  - Procedural programming languages include C, C++, C#, Python, Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript.
- Event-Driven
  - Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or messages from other programs or threads.
  - Event-driven programming languages include JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, C#, C++, and C.
- Logic
  - Logic programming is a programming paradigm that is a declarative programming paradigm. In logic programming, the programmer describes the logic of a computation directly as a set of logical assertions, known as facts and rules.
  - Logic programming languages include Prolog.
- Concurrent
  - Concurrent programming is a programming paradigm in which several computations are executed during overlapping time periods.
  - Concurrent programming languages include Java, C#, C++, C, Python, Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript.
- Meta
  - Meta programming is a programming technique in which computer programs have the ability to treat programs as their data.
  - Meta programming languages include Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, F#, C#, C++, C, Python, Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript.
- Functional Reactive
  - Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is a programming paradigm for reactive programming using the building blocks of functional programming (e.g. pure functions, immutable data, higher-order functions, recursion).
  - Functional Reactive Programming languages include Elm, ClojureScript, F#, C#, C++, C, Python, Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript.
