**Question 1**\
suppose in a section there are 30 students.
- create a database of 30 students with their name, id and contact(email) information
- some students may exchange their section. for that we need to add or remove students from that database. so, implement add & a delete operation which will let remove/add student one by one from database.
- we might need to update information of a perticular student. for that implement an update operation.
- make a function that generates unique student id
- implement a functionality for sending email to students

hint - array operations, do 5 students for solving purpose

**Question 2**\
you are given a userData. create a promise from this data then try printing the data from promise

```js
{
  name: "johnson & johnson",
  age: 30,
  designation: "software dev",
  salary: "300k",
};
```

**Question 3**
```js
const arr = [1, 2, "3", 4, "5", 6, 7, 8, "9"];
```
 - extract only the number types elements using loop, forEach, map, filter and reduce methods.
 - also, try to solve the problem using any kind of algorithm which does not required any auxiliary space.
 `output-> [1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8]`

**Question 4**
create an student Object with
